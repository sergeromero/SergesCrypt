# SergesCrypt
This is a NodeJS/ExpressJS application that represents a text based - first person - maze game.
It is based on the example code "The Crypt" from the book "Getting Programming with JavaScript"
by John R. Larsen.

By doing this project I hope to accomplish the following objectives:

1. Have a solid foundation of how to build a website using ExpressJS and the NodeJS technology stack.
2. Since I have not found an example that shows a way to organize an ExpressJS project suitable for 
   a production environment I am hoping to come up with something that would reasonably fullfill that
   goal.
3. Incorporate good software development and engineering practices, including but not limited to:
    - Linting and unit testing
    - One click build
    - One click new developers on boarding
4. Minimize the polution of the project of third party libraries by using only the ones that provide
   the most value and are needed since what they provide is not available by tools already included
   like npm.
